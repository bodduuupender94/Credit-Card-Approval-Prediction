Machine Learning is an application that provides
computers the ability to learn and improve from the experience without 
being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning is classified into different 
types. They are as follows:
1)Supervised Learning:
Supervised learning is the task of machine learning that maps the input 
to an output based on input-output patterns to the system. 
Supervised learning is classified into two types of regression and 
classification.
A) Regression: Regression is classified under the same branch of 
supervised learning. In machine learning regression algorithm try’s to 
estimate the mapping function(f) from the variable (x) to numerical or 
continuous output variable(y).
Example: To predict the prices of the houses, that is the regression task 
because price 
of the houses will be the continuous output.
B) Classification: Classification is classified under the same branch of 
supervised learning. In machine learning classification algorithm try’s to 
calculate the mapping function(f) from the input (x) to discrete or 
categorial output variables(y).
Example: To predict the prices of the houses “sell more or less than the 
recommended retail price.” Here, the houses will be classified whether 
their prices fall into two discrete categories: above or below the said 
price
